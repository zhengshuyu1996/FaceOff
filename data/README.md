## Dataset

`download/urls.txt` lists the webpage URLs we used in our work.

Run

```shell
$ cd download/
$ ./download_all.sh
```

The script will crawl webpages and capture snapshots automatically. It takes several hours to get all webpages. You may need a vpn to access some of the webpages in our list.
